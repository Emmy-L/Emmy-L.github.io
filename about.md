Hi there! My name's Emmy. I'm a 2nd year PhD student at Princeton University in the Quantum Science and Engineering (QSE) program, working in the [Tureci Group](https://turecigroup.princeton.edu/). You can read a bit about my research [here](https://turecigroup.princeton.edu/people/emmy-linden).

Right now, the only thing this website is being used for is lifting the lid a little on grad school and making some information more accessible. However, I would like to build up more content over time to engage in one of my lifelong passionsâ€”teaching!

title: So you want to apply to grad school?
---
Below is all of my advice. Also, I tried to include enough detail so that if you have no idea where to start in the process, this page will walk you through it.

> *Context in which to interpret my advice: I applied for physics programs to study theoretical quantum science. I applied to 10 US universities for the Fall of 2024 (note this is before the budget cuts), and was accepted to 4. I am a US citizen. I graduated from Arizona State University with a Bachelor’s in Physics and minor in Mathematics.*

## Checklist (Semi-chronological):
1. Ask 3-4 professors to be your letter of recommendation writers.
2. Make a list of grad schools you want to apply to, and check **fee waivers**.
3. (Optional) Reach out to professors at your prospective schools.
4. Write your Statement of Purpose (SOP)
5. Write other application essays and gather other materials (transcript, etc.)
6. (Optional) Apply to fellowships/scholarships.

## 1. Letters of Rec
You really want to give your recommenders at least a 4-6 week heads up, but the earlier the better. A given school will only require you to submit 3 letters of rec, but sometimes asking a 4th is a good security measure. If you have 4, separate their letters into whatever split you want so that you submit 3 letters to each school (submitting an extra won’t help you). At the bottom of this page is a template to ask someone to be your recommender. 

Once you have your list of schools, send each recommender an organized table with all of the schools where you want them to submit a letter for you, and each school's corresponding submission deadline.

## 2. List of Schools
This is a nontrivial step (at least in terms of time), and I for one had no idea where to start. You want to aim to have a list of anywhere from 8 to 12 schools (some people go up to 20). I applied to 10. 

#### Where to start?
Ask a mentor to recommend a few schools that might be hubs for your area of interest. You can do research online for this as well. Also, check out the Big 10 Alliance schools, where you can [apply](https://btaa.org/resources-for/students/freeapp/eligibility) to get the application fees waived (otherwise, application fees can unfortunately cost you $50-$100 a pop). If all else fails, start looking into schools that are in an area you'd like to live for the next several years.

#### Criteria:
Many people have different criteria for narrowing down their list, but I went off of a singular metric: amount of professors whose research interests me and with whom I would like to work (ie. **number of potential advisors**). Here was my method: for a given school, go to the program you’re applying to (ex. Physics), go to the faculty page, then go through literally every professor and, if you are interested in their research, add them to a list of potential advisors for that school. If in the end you find at least 2 but preferably 3-4 potential advisors you’d be interested in working with, then you probably want to apply to that school. The reason this method was effective for me in particular is because most schools have fewer physics faculty working in theory and fewer still in my area of interest (theoretical quantum info), but if your interests are much more open-ended, you can incorporate other criteria to narrow down your list.

#### Fee waivers:
Look into fee waviers. Application fees add up and can be a significant road block to applying, so it’s nice to get a couple of them waived. I already mentioned the [Big 10 Alliance](https://btaa.org/resources-for/students/freeapp/eligibility). Some schools also have internal protocol for this, and have a section towards the end of the application that lets you separately apply for a fee waiver (ex. I think Boulder has this, and you just have to submit a short essay explaining why you need it). Some of them require your FAFSA or some documentation, though.

## 3. Reaching out to potential advisors
This is one of my biggest pieces of advice: reach out to the professors you’re interested in working with, ask to meet with them, ask them about their research, etc. so they know who you are when it’s time to review applications. There’s no harm to this, and they might not respond or have time to meet with you–that’s okay. There’s also no real deadline to do this, as long as it’s before decisions come out (because it wouldn’t make sense after…), but I think a good time would be around November. Template at the bottom of page for how to write this email.

## 4. Statement of Purpose (SOP)
#### What is it? 
Your SOP answers the question, “Why are you applying for this program?” There is a lot of stuff packed in that “Why”—Why do you want to study X? (which begs the question, What is X? What do you want to study?) Why do you want to go to grad school? Why do you want to go to *this* school and *this* program? And, debatably the most important, Why should we choose you?

All grad schools require the SOP and are expecting this same thing, so you can keep it the same except when explaining your reasons for applying to each specific school and program, which you should tailor. **By the way**, all applications have a section where they ask you to list all the other schools you're applying to—just leave this blank.

#### Lots of advice here:
* Somewhere near the beginning, you need to have a ‘thesis statement’ that says what specifically you want to study/work on in grad school. This should be clear from the get-go. By the way, it will be professors in your field reading this, so you can be technical.
* At some point (I did it at the end) you’re going to include the **specific names** of professors in the department you’re applying to that you’d like to work with. 
* You’re obviously going to talk about research experience (if any), classes, awards, clubs and any other things that make you qualified. Don’t forget to make it clear that you enjoy this stuff–sometimes that gets lost in writing. Also, again, don’t be afraid to be a little technical when writing about research experience: show that you understand the stuff and highlight your contributions. 
* Don’t brush off the question, “Why do you want to go to grad school?” Let them know that you understand the unique challenge of grad school and that you’re committed to it for xyz reasons.
* Also don’t forget to answer the question “Why this school and program?”. Can just be 1 maybe 2 sentences.
* If you have any experience with teaching/tutoring, public outreach, volunteering, supporting underrepresented groups, etc, let them know. If you’re highlighting it more in a different essay you can keep it brief. It’s very good in academia to be interested in this stuff.

#### Extra help
Feel free to reach out to me and I will send you my SOP assuming 2 things: (1) you don’t share it with anyone (just have them ask me directly), and (2) you already have a draft written. The first is for my sake so it doesn’t get spread online, and the second is for your own sake, as it can be so hard to not copy someone else’s layout and style once you’ve read their writing.

Send an email to el4436@princeton.edu with the subject “Requesting SOP,” and in the body introduce yourself if you want. I am also willing to proofread your draft if I have time, but no promises I get to it. :)

## 5. Other application materials
I have no advice here.

## 6. Fellowships
If you have time, apply to fellowships like NSF and Quad, or any internal scholarships the schools have. If you do apply for these, you can include this info in your application which advisors like to see. Unfortunately, many of the fellowships are reserved for US citizens. :(
